# ATTiny85-Scanner-Radio
Airband Scanner on an ATTiny85 using Si5351 and not much else!

This is a work in progress, but feel free to copy stuff and play with it. The code uses my own minimised Si5351 library which you can find [here](https://github.com/G1OJS/G1OJS_Tiny_Si5351_CLK0). There's also a schematic and a model of the MC1350 that I made from the schematic in the datasheet.
